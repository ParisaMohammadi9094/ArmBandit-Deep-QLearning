**Introduction**

This repository contains an implementation of the Multi-Armed Bandit problem using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) in PyTorch. The goal is to demonstrate how reinforcement learning can be applied to solve the Multi-Armed Bandit problem and compare the performance with a random agent.

**Setup**

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.7 or higher and the following dependencies:

- **NumPy**
- **PyTorch**
- **Matplotlib**

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy torch matplotlib
